 * TODO:
 * Incomplete list:
 * - major number from maintainer?
 * - honor cs_gpio and allow SPI where idle_cs == active_cs
 * - missing mechanism to notify external entities of changes to gpio and
 *   the dedicated "interrupt counter" line.
 *
 * Fix list:
 * - While we wont see it on x86 & little-endian arm, the flipping
 *   ctl_complete_urb() may be broken when processing data from the request
 *   buffer. -- PROBABLY FIXED
 * - Using the packed version of protocol structs is bloating code horribly,
 *   even worse than I had guessed it would!! So we need to have packed and
 *   unpacked versions of these structs replace the is_mcp_endianness and
 *   "flipping" functionality with conversions from packed (protocol-correct)
 *   little-endian structs to unpacked native-endianness structs.
 * - When a command dies and can't be retried, we need to do something more
 *   than just log it.  Re-implement device failure?
 * - Change ioctl to netlink.
 * - ioctl interface not friendly with ABIs where kernel & user space have
 *   different sized ptrs (x32, sparc64, etc.) (Maybe fix this when we convert
 *   to netlink)
 * - In struct gpio_chip allocate only the number of gpios for pins that are
 *   configured for it. This will require a revmap.
 * - Now that IRQs are working, we have an issue with threaded/non- because gpio
 *   get() and set() can currently sleep. We probably need to have a specifier
 *   in the configuration for threaded or not, so that non-threaded IRQs can
 *   still be used in situtations where it would be more appripriate -- but not
 *   for SPI transfers, writing gpios (unless we add some type of async
 *   functionality) or reading gpios (again, unless we add some type of "last
 *   known value" functionality).
 * - Improve the way that spi_mcp_error() (and the rest of the SPI code) decides
 *   how much time to wait.
 *
 * Tweak list:
 * - examine locking and possibly (hopefully) refine
 * - better prediction of how long SPI transfers will take and appropriate
 *   scheduling so that we don't unnecessarily request a status (update: this
 *   has some stuff now, but it may need an audit) Update2: it's likely that
 *   getting too many 0xf8s slows down the device
 * - include/linux/spi/spi.h: extend mode (to u16), spi_device, et. al. to
 *   accommodate missing features (timing, drop cs between words, etc.) (note
 *   current work with DUAL and QUAD on linux-spi)
 *   - update spidev driver & userspace to support
 *   - update mcp2210 driver to use them.

 *
 * Background:
 *
 * The MCP2210 is a USB-to-SPI protocol converter with GPIO by Microchip.  It
 * uses a basic 64-byte request/response protocol for all operations, advertises
 * its self as a generic HID device and can be used via the hid-generic driver
 * from userspace using the hidraw /dev node.  A more friendly interface is
 * available via Kerry Wong's MCP2210-Library
 * (https://github.com/kerrydwong/MCP2210-Library) which is built on top of
 * Signal 11's hidapi library (http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi) which in turn
 * uses libusb.  All together, it gives you a pretty user-friendly userland
 * interface to to the device, but carries the following drawbacks:
 *
 * - Extensive overhead: hid-core driver -> usbhid driver -> (hid-generic
 *   driver) -> libusb -> hidapi -> MCP2210-Library means lots of memory & CPU.
 *   (Note however that hid-generic is virtually non-existent.) Additionally,
 *   an embedded system will have to enable the input and HID layers that it
 *   otherwise may not require.
 * - No way to use SPI protocol drivers to manage peripherals on the other side
 *   of the MCP2210.
 * - No mechanism for auto-configuration outside of userland.
 *
 * This driver attempts to solve these shortcomings by eliminating all of these
 * layers, including the kernel's input, hid, hid-core, usbhid, etc.,
 * communicating with the MCP2210 directly via interrupt URBs and allowing your
 * choice of spi protocol driver for each SPI device, with the standard option
 * of spidev for interacting with the SPI device from userspace.  In addition,
 * it supplies an (optional) auto-configuration scheme which utilizes the
 * devices 256 bytes of user EEPROM to store the wiring information for the
 * board and a fairly complete ioctl interface for userland configuration,
 * testing and such.
 *
 * Theory of Operation:
 * ===================
 *
 * Commands and The Command Queue
 * ------------------------------
 * The MCP2210 driver is a queue-driven USB interface driver.  All commands are
 * executed (or given the opportunity) serially, in FIFO order.  Only one
 * command may execute at a time.  Each command represents a logically atomic
 * operation (e.g., send SPI transfer or query settings) and typically exchanges
 * at least one message with the device via interrupt URBs.
 *
 * Commands are objects of either struct mcp2210_cmd or a derived-type using
 * pseudo-inheritance -- embedding a struct mcp2210_cmd object as its first
 * member and using a type field to specify the command type.  There are three
 * different types of "normal" commands that interact with the device directly.
 * Each populate the cmd->type with a pointer to an appropriate struct
 * mcp2210_cmd_type object:
 *
 * 1. Transfer SPI messages (mcp2210-spi.c)
 * 2. Read/write to/from the device's user-EEPROM area (mcp2210-eeprom.c)
 * 3. Query and change settings (mcp2210-ctl.c)
 *
 * General-purpose commands have have a NULL command type, but will populate
 * cmd->complete and cmd->context to defer some work, possibly to execute in a
 * non-atomic context.  Currently, these are only used to probe spi and gpio,
 * neither of which can be probed at the time the USB interface is probed
 * because the information to do so is not yet available.  This occurs either
 * when the user-EEPROM area has been read and decoded (when
 * CONFIG_MCP2210_CREEK is enabled) or when the configure ioctl command is
 * called from userspace.
 *
 * Delayed & Non-Atomic Commands
 * -----------------------------
 * Due to the nature of the device, having:
 *
 * 1. a single USB interface,
 * 2. potentially multiple SPI peripherals connected to it,
 * 3. the need to poll its gpio values & interrupt counter, and
 * 4. late arrival of wiring information to perform a complete probe (with SPI
 *    & GPIO),
 *
 * the driver requires a slightly more sophisticated mechanism for processing
 * commands than a simple FIFO queue processed by URB completion handlers.
 * Polling commands need to be delayed.  SPI Transfers (especially on slower
 * chips) often need to have delays between URBs to give the device time to
 * complete transfers to the chip.  Performing the configure (probing spi_master
 * and gpio_chip) must occur in a context that can sleep.  If a command needs to
 * be delayed, its cmd->delayed bit is set and cmd->delay_until will specify a
 * time (in jiffies) that the command is to run at.  If the command must be able
 * to sleep, it's cmd->nonatomic bit will be set.
 *
 * Note that there is no mechanism (at this time) to assure that a delayed
 * command will execute at its requested time, although it is guaranteed not
 * to execute prior to it.  Delayed commands who's cmd->delay_until time has
 * been reached still have to wait their turn in the queue to be eligible for
 * execution.  If a delayed command is popped from the queue but its
 * cmd->delay_until time has not yet arrived, it is moved to the
 * dev->delayed_list and an appropriate mechanism (either timer or
 * delayed_work) is set to pick it up.  If another command is executing when
 * the timer expires or delayed_work runs, the delayed command is (effectively)
 * moved to the head of the queue and will execute next.
 *
 * process_commands():
 * ------------------
 * Messages in the queue are processed via process_commands().  If dev->cur_cmd
 * is NULL, it will attempt to retrieve a command from the queue, marking its
 * state as new.  How it processes commands differs between "normal" commands
 * (which interact with the MCP2210) and general-purpose commands (which are
 * simply some delayed work)
 *
 * -- Normal Commands
 * If there is a normal command in the new state, submit_urbs() is called and
 * its state is set to "submitted".  Completion handlers for the in and out URBs
 * will eventually be called (if the usb host driver behaves) marking the
 * command as "completed" and calling process_commands() to have the completed
 * command finalized.  Finalization is performed by calling struct mcp2210_cmd's
 * complete function (if non-NULL) and freeing it.  Then, the next message is
 * retrieved, and so forth.
 *
 * -- General-Purpose Commands
 * For general-purpose commands, submit/complete_urbs() is bypassed and it is
 * instead immediately marked as completed having its complete() function
 * called, allowing any arbitrary work to be performed.
 *
 * -- Deferred Work
 * A command may be deferred because:
 * a. it needs to wait before starting,
 * c. it needs to run again, but needs to wait before doing so, or
 * b. it needs to run in a non-atomic state.
 *
 * submit_urbs():
 * -------------
 * This function will first call the command type's submit_prepare() function,
 * which should perform any needed initialization, populate the 64-byte request
 * message and return non-zero unless it has an error.  However, there are two
 * exceptions to this: submit_prepare() may return -ERESTARTSYS to have the
 * command deleted w/o further processing or -EAGAIN to have the message
 * restarted and submit_urbs() called again).  It will then submit the URBS and
 * change the command's state to "submitted".
 *
 * complete_urb():
 * This function manages both the in & out URBs.
 *
 * Once both URBs have completed,
 * the command type's complete_urb() function is called and the command's
 * state is set to "completed".
 *
#if 0
out of date info:
 * When the in URB completes, complete_urb_in() performs the following:
 * - basic sanity checks & URB status via check_urb_status()
 * - sets command status to "sent"
 * - calls the command type's complete_tx() function (if it has one)
 *
 * complete_urb_out():
 * Similarly, when the out URB completes, complete_urb_out() performs
 * the following:
 * - calls check_urb_status() and exits upon error
 * - checks for and handles out-of-order responses
 * - sets the command status to "done"
 * - checks the status field and general validity of the response message via
 *   check_response().
 * - calls complete_rx()
 * - if complete_rx() returns -EAGAIN, the command's state is reset to "new" so
 *   that the next call to process_commands will run it again.
 * - calls process_commands() (in GFP_ATOMIC mode) to process the next command.
